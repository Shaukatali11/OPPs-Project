Steps to Implement the System

Step 1: Define the Product Class:
We start by defining the Product class, which holds product details and manages input/output using getter and setter methods.
  Private Data Members: We define the attributes of a product (ID, name, price, quantity) as private to protect data.
  Getter and Setter Methods: These methods allow controlled access and modification of the private members.
  Input Method: To allow the admin to add new products by getting input from the user.


Step 2: Define the Supermarket Class
The Supermarket class will manage all the products and user interactions, including adding, modifying, viewing products, and handling customer orders.
  addProduct(): Allows the admin to add new products to the system. It collects input and pushes the product to the products vector.
  displayProducts(): Displays all available products, making it easy for both admins and customers to view the stock.
  modifyProduct(): Modifies a product's details based on the product ID.
  deleteProduct(): Deletes a product based on the product ID.
  handleCustomer(): Allows a customer to select products, add them to a cart, and then generate a bill based on the selected items.
  generateBill(): Calculates and prints the total bill for the items in the cart.


Step 3: Create the Main Program
Now, we create the main() function to interact with the admin and customers. The admin can add, modify, and delete products, while the customer can place orders.
